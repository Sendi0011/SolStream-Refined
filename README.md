## 🎵 SolStream

**SolStream** is a **Web3 music streaming platform** built on **Solana**, designed to empower artists and engage fans through a **points-based reward system** — not NFTs or tokens.
Artists earn up to **80% of streaming revenue**, maintain control over their fan data, and fans earn **reward points** for listening and engagement, which can be converted to **SOL** or **Solana-based tokens** once a threshold is reached.

## 🔁 System Flow

### **User Flow**

1. **Artist signs up** and uploads music via dashboard.
2. **Fan streams music**, triggering smart contract events.
3. **Points are awarded** to both the artist and the fan.
4. Once points reach a threshold (e.g., 1,000 pts), users can
   **convert points → SOL** via the Rust contract.
5. **Dashboard updates** show real-time balances and engagement metrics.

### **Smart Contract Flow (Rust / Solana Program)**

1. `register_user()` — Registers artist/fan on-chain.
2. `record_stream()` — Called each time a track is streamed; logs play and allocates points.
3. `add_points()` — Updates user’s point balance.
4. `convert_points_to_sol()` — Converts points to SOL at a predefined exchange rate once threshold reached.
5. `withdraw_sol()` — Transfers SOL to user wallet.

Would you like me to make this **investor-friendly** (pitch-deck tone, shorter, sleek design) or **developer-focused** (with code samples and API references)?
